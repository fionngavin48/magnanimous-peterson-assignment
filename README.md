# Magnanimous & Peterson Number Checker

Overview

This Java program allows users to input whole numbers and checks whether they are Magnanimous numbers and/or Peterson numbers. It was created as a submission for a Java assignment in Intro to Programming 1 for first-year Computer Science at Trinity College Dublin (TCD).

Features

Accepts user input of whole numbers.
Determines if the number is a Magnanimous number (a number that remains divisible by the sum of its parts when split at any position).
Determines if the number is a Peterson number (a number where the sum of the factorial of its digits equals the number itself).
Outputs the results in a user-friendly format.

Example Output

Enter a whole number: 145

145 is a Peterson number.

145 is not a Magnanimous number.

Future Improvements

Add a GUI for a more interactive experience.
Support batch input for checking multiple numbers at once.
Expand the program to check for additional special number types.
